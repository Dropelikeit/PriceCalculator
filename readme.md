### Example
```
$vat = 19; // Value added tax in Germany
$total = 0;
$price = 300; // cent
$priceCalculator = new PriceCalculator($vat);
$amount = $priceCalculator->addPrice($total, $price); // amount in cent

// If you want to calculate the price including sales tax, use the following method.
$amount = $priceCalculator->calculatePriceWithSalesTax($amount);

// convert to Euro
$amount = (float)$priceCalculator->calculateCentToEuro($amount);
    
$formatter = new PriceFormatter();
echo $formatter->formatPrice($amount, 2, ',', '.', 'â‚¬');
